## Overview

The game starts with Haruka waking up alone in a dark classroom. After finding her classmate Yuuya Itou’s clothes and equipment, she’s contacted by Takumi, his older brother, through a portable radio among Itou’s equipment. After fighting off a minor spirit, Takumi tells Haruka that his younger brother is part of an international organization working to secure and contain paranormal anomalies, and that the fact that she survived this entity’s attack means she has tremendous spiritual potential at least on par with Itou’s. He also explains their current predicament: a massive feeder spirit essentially kidnapped the entire school’s souls for his consumption. The entity is hiding somewhere in the school, growing larger with every soul it consumes, and can only be killed at dusk or dawn– meaning Haruka has to first survive the night if she wants even a shot at ending this nightmare.

The main portion of the act consists of exploring the school looking for clues on Itou’s whereabouts as well as a way to break the barrier before night.This act features a few basic enemies littered throughout the school’s west wing

The act concludes by finding a wounded Itou and receiving the remainder of his power, before jumping into a flashback sequence that kicks off Act 2.

## Intro Script

Pain. The first thing you feel, before you can even process it, is pain.

You open your eyes.  As your vision returns to you, the room wobbles and spins. Your head pounds violently and your vision is blurry and unfocused. Touch follows, and you feel the cold hardwood floor beneath your fingertips. Your body complains about every minuscule movement.

My head… oh, it hurts…

You lay back down.

Where the hell… I can’t… remember…

Trying to recall things jolts painful signals in your brain, like a needle scratching the inside of your skull. After what feels like minutes, your brain gives up the tiniest amount of information. “The school”, you think. You went back to the school for… something. It was late. Dark. You try to recall what it was, but the needle scratches again. You grit your teeth and hold back a tear. It really, really hurts.

You hear crackling static in the distance. It seems far away at first, but as your senses sharpen, you determine that it’s actually just a few feet from you. You take a deep breath and pull yourself up, one painful movement at a time.

You notice a set of clothes on the ground, only feet away from you. The nameplate on the breast pocket reads “Yuuya Itou”. The needle scratches yet again, but through the pain your brain returns information– you recognize the name. Itou is a classmate. A friend. Confused and lethargic, you don’t react much, until the static crackles again– and this time, you can also make out a voice.

“Itou… Itou, are you there?” The voice waits a few seconds before returning. “Itou, they lost your reading. Please respond.”

You reach for your pocket and pull out your phone. The screen lights up at full brightness, making you squint your eyes. The battery is at 80%, but there’s no reception. You tap the flashlight icon and look around the room.  Something sinks in your stomach a little, and you instinctively move closer to the radio.

“Itou, are you okay? Please respond.” The voice sounds a little worried now. 

You look around the room again, and it’s only now that you notice the desks– you’re in a classroom. The chairs and desks are a bit all over the place, but the sign above the door confirms it: you’re in class 2-B, your classroom. 

Your legs aren’t carrying you anywhere any time soon, so you reach for the radio, sit down on a chair and press the button.

“H-Hello…? Is anyone there?”

The voice replies almost immediately.

“Itou?!”

Now that you’re listening closely, you can tell that the person on the other end is a male. His voice is firm and kind, like a nice teacher.

“No, I’m… my name is Haruka. Tachibana Haruka. I’m Itou’s friend.”

“Where’s Itou? What happened to him?” The voice is trying to keep his composure, but you can tell he’s still worried.

“I… I don’t know. I can see his clothes on the floor, but there’s no sight of him.”

“Fuck… fuck fuck fuck…” You can hear a deep breath coming from the speaker. After a moment, the voice returns. “Sorry for the language. You said you’re Tachibana, right?”

“Yeah. Haruka’s fine, though. If you don’t mind me asking, who are you?”

“I’m Itou’s older brother, Yuuya Takumi.”

The needle scratches your skull once again, giving brief flashes of memory. You and Itou have been friends since middle school, but you can’t recall ever meeting his older brother. But then again, you can’t recall much at all right now.

“It’s nice to meet you, Takumi.”

“You too, Haruka. Look, I know this is sudden but…” Takumi seems to hesitate for a moment, but he continues. “...Haruka, do you see blood anywhere?”

You can feel the urgence in his tone.

“What? Blood? No, there’s no blood… Why would I see blood?”

He seems to bulldoze right through your question.

“Thank God… We need to find Itou, and quickly.”

“Sure, I’ll help you look for him. But… why? Are you worried something happened to him?”

“Yes. But right now, I’m more worried about you." He seems to swallow hard. "Haruka, you’re in danger.”

His statement makes you pause. Your stomach sinks a little deeper, and you now get the sense that something is wrong.

“D-Danger… why would I be in danger?”

Again, he ignores your question.

“You said Itou’s clothes are there, right? I need you to look through his stuff.”

“What? Why?”
  
“Please just trust me, you don’t have a lot of time. I need you to grab his armband, his pouch and his gun.”

“His *gun*?! Why would Itou have a gun at school? What’s going on here?!”

“There’s no time! They’re gonna show up any minute now. I’ll explain everything later, so just trust me!”  
  
“‘They’? Who the hell is ‘ they’? Takumi-san, what the hell are you talking–”

The radio static grows louder, and Takumi’s voice becomes distant and choppy. There’s a very present chill in the room, like someone suddenly turned on the AC on full blast. 

“Grab the g… (static) …be calm, just… (static) …and shoot! Don’t… (static) …it touch you!”

# Act 2

## Overview

In this act we play as Itou in a sort of flashback sequence, showing the beginning of his mission.  

We find out that what the agency thought was a simple feeder spirit turned out to be a massively powerful entity– so powerful, in fact, that the barrier it erected around the school to feed off the students uninterrupted was all but impenetrable. With no choice but to take on the spirit on his own, Itou and Takumi marched onwards. 

  

# Act 3

## Overview

In this act, we go back to playing as Haruka. Now equipped with what remained of Itou’s spiritual energy, Haruka explores the rest of the school gathering supplies to treat Itou’s wound. Takumi seems to protest Itou’s directions, but an unspoken agreement between the two keeps the older brother from expressing his true feelings.

It turns out that instead of a cure, Itou was instructing Haruka to gather components for a ritual that would successfully seal the spirit– at the cost of his own life. His wounds were too severe and the corruption had spread too far– he was beyond saving.Upon hearing Itou’s instructions, Takumi immediately knew what his younger brother was up to, but also understood that it was the only way to save both the trapped students and Haruka. After making their way to the gym– the place where the monster is slowly feeding off of the student’s souls–, Haruka uses her newfound abilities to hold the entity back while Itou performs the rite. Upon successfully sealing the spirit, the souls of the students return to their bodies and the barrier is broken. With connection to the outside world now restored, Takumi requests backup from the 

Takumi and Haruka grieve the loss of Itou, and Haruka is offered a position as an agent, which she accepts. She urges Takumi to resign his service to the agency and go join his brother in heaven, but he refuses, saying that “Itou would never forgive me if I left without making sure you were alright for a while. Besides, you’re almost like a little sister to me.” He ultimately decides to stay and aid Haruka in her journey to becoming an agent.

  

# Epilogue

*October 12th, 2010*

Detective Kurokawa has once again run into a wall. It’s the third unexplained disappearance in two weeks, and just like the previous two times, his leads have led absolutely nowhere. The clusterfuck of case documents and half-legible notes littering his desk looks no different than it did yesterday, which looked no different than the day before that. “People don’t. Just. Vanish.”, he thought, taking a long drag from his cigarette and massaging his temples in frustration. He only picks up his desk phone after the fourth ring.

“H-Hello! This is Kurokawa”, he stumbles. The voice on the other end– that of Police Chief Iwacho– isn’t at all surprised by his clumsiness.

“Wash your face and come to my office. There’s a big shot here that wants to talk to you.”

“I’m in trouble again, aren’t I?” Kurokawa thought, but resigned to respond with a simple “Yes sir.”

The cold water was still dripping down his face when he opened the office door.  
  
“Sorry for the wait, Chief…” He said sheepishly.

“Don’t mind it, it’s fine.” the chief responded. “Detective, this young woman is here to assist with your investigation.”

Kurokawa looked at the occupied chair at the other end of the table. A slender-framed, college age girl sat politely, a single pink-colored streak gracefully accentuating her long, straight brown hair. She greeted him with a smile.

“Hello detective. It’s a pleasure to meet you.”

Before Kurokawa could stumble out a response, a crackled voice came from a speaker somewhere on her person.  
  
We’re good to go. Everything’s in order.

Kurokawa looked at the girl in confusion as she stood up.

“Thank you, Takumi. Well then, detective. Shall we get going?”

Kurokawa looked at the police chief, and then back at the girl. Confused, he stammered out a response.

“S-Sure, but… who are you again?”

“She’s a Closer” the chief interjected. “It seems your case wasn’t one of the normal ones after all…”

The young woman extended a polite handshake.

“I’m Inspector Tachibana. Tachibana Haruka.”
