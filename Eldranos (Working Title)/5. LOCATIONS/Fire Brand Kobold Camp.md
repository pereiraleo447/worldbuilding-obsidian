# OVERVIEW

> *The encampment is made up of a number of different tents and locations, with dirt paths in between them. The camp is thick with kobolds everywhere.*

While trying to gain access to the caverns in which Mother Krangor shelters, the players begin to discern what kind of threat she and her cult poses.

Players can either try to sneak through the encampment unseen, avoiding the large number of kobolds roaming around and guarding the tents; or go in guns blazing, setting the kobold’s tents on fire and killing any who dare to approach. 

# OBJECTIVE(S)

The player character’s ultimate goal is to gain access to the caverns. At the far edge of the camp lies a 6ft-wide, 8ft-tall gash in the cliff face that leads deep into the dark earth. It is always guarded by a ***Fire Brand Kobold Champion*** who won’t leave their post for *any* reason.

# MECHANICS

## Enemies

- One kobold outside each tent
- One kobold guarding the Shrine
- Two kobolds guarding the pit
- Two Snake-mounted kobolds patrolling the edge of the camp at all times

If they encounter the players, they try to keep them at a distance and buy time to call for help. Once reinforcements arrive, they surround the players and alternate attacks with ***********Pack Tactics***********. **Magic-users are particular targets—** not only are the kobolds afraid of the spells, they believe that offering their blood to [Mother Krangor](https://www.notion.so/Mother-Krangor-28149fe574394bff8651e3a479b02c66?pvs=21)  will substantially increase her magical prowess.

## Reinforcements

If the players are spotted by kobolds, or if they attack and are unable to kill them in 2 turns, the kobolds will shriek for help. This alerts any kobolds within 50ft of the caller, and triggers the arrival of ***Reinforcements*** in 5 combat turns, or within 2 minutes.

- ******************************************Reinforcements:****************************************** 1 Priest of the Bloody Flame + another two mounted kobolds (typically— vary at your discretion).
- Priest hangs back in combat, playing spells and keeping his range.
- Mounted kobolds take the offensive, joining their companions in combat.

# 1. THE ALTAR

> ***Large and clearly made by craftsman far more skilled than the kobolds that now use it, the altar is stained with the blood of the victims who’ve gone beneath the Priests of the Bloody Flame’s knives. It emanates a sullen, evil presence.***
> 
- Any neutral or good aligned characters who come within 5ft of the altar are struck by horrifying visions of death and destruction, and must make a **WIS saving throw** or be **frightened until they move away.** This effect does not affect magic-users.
- Magic-users within 5ft of the altar make **all checks with disadvantage**, regardless of alignment.

### Secrets and Clues

- [ ]  The altar is ancient— much more ancient than the kobolds, apart from [Mother Krangor](https://www.notion.so/Mother-Krangor-28149fe574394bff8651e3a479b02c66?pvs=21), realize. There are two very distinct sets of runes etched onto the stone: the original inscriptions are much more polished when compared to the more recent, cruder carvings from the kobold’s tools and weapons. (Inv 12, Arc 12)
- [ ]  A successful DC 12 Arcana or History check connects the original set of runes to the Dragon Cult of Tiamat

# 2. THE SHRINE

> *************************************Made from the bones of sacrificial victims, glittering red scales, dragon teeth and a collection of peculiarly shaped kobold skulls, the shrine is an object of worship for the Fire Brands. As Mother Krangor is seldom seen outside her caverns— and even then, only by her chosen guards— the kobolds pray to this shrine as a surrogate. The sigil at its center, now corrupted from her magicks, gives the kobolds near it a strange, trance-like invigoration.*************************************

- Whenever a kobold is **within 5ft** of the Shrine, **they gain a free bonus action**.
- Removing the Sigil from the strange nexus of bones and blood seems to **deactivate its power**.

### Secrets and Clues

- [ ]  A successful **Arcana(20)** or **History(20)** check identifies this as a Sigil of the Dragon— a physical manifestation of a dragon’s magic. It is seldom granted to any creature, as even non-evil dragons are very protective of their power. [Marleen Elric](https://www.notion.so/Marleen-Elric-aa516574d220491d9678f5a1d8ddd501?pvs=21) in Phandelin can also identify this item, in case the party misses the check.

# 3. THE PIT

> ***Mother Krangor demands blood, both for her magic rites as well as to offer to the dragon under her thrall. The intended sacrificial victims are kept in a pit close to the altar, so that they can be quickly dragged to the site of their eventual death. The pit is 12ft deep and the walls are lined with protruding sharp objects like glass, iron nails and dragon teeth— all effective at deterring potential escapees.***

- If a PC is captured, **the kobolds will try to stabilize them**. Not out of kindness, of course; Mother demands blood, and dead victims offer little. Regardless if the attempt is successful or not, the kobolds will then **dump the players** in the pit, **inflicting standard(1d4) piercing damage.**
- The players will see one of the surviving members of the scout party be dragged out of the pit and dragged to the mouth of the cavern as they approach.

# 4. THE FORGE

> ***Sacred to the Cult of the Bloody Flame, lava plays an important role in their rituals. While Mother Krangor’s caverns span a number of lava rivers, little is accessible from the surface. To address this, the kobolds converted a half tent and a looted blacksmith’s forge and use it to maintain a supply of sacred lava in a large iron trough. Constantly heated to ensure it stays molten, this lava is used to initiate new members into the cult.***

- Infused with [Mother Krangor](https://www.notion.so/Mother-Krangor-28149fe574394bff8651e3a479b02c66?pvs=21) ‘s mixtures, the lava has strange hallucinogenic properties and emits a thick, toxic fug. Any non-Kobold within the forge must make a **Constitution** saving throw or take **standard(1d4) Poison damage** and suffer the **Poisoned condition for 1d3 rounds**.

# 5 KOBOLD HUTS

> ***There are a number of huts where the kobolds who gather in the camp eat, sleep and generally do those things which don’t involve the sinister worship of dragons and bloody sacrifice. They seem to be made out of a combination of animal leather, kobold hide and human skin…***
> 
- The huts are easily entered through the front, or the players can cut their way in with a ********Strength(12)******** or **************************Dexterity(12)************************** check.

The contents of the huts can be determined by rolling on the following table:

| 1d8 | Result | Items |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1-2 | Two kobolds are in here, fast asleep. Their thin, rasping snores fill the tent. Around them are piles of skin and what you would expect from a kobold hut: half-gnawed bones, discarded hunks of metal and so on. Moving through undetected requires a successful Dexterity (Stealth) check. | N/A |
| 3-4 | Faces. The wall is hung with the flensed faces of scores of victims, carefully peeled from the skull— thought the skulls themselves are nowhere to be seen. The rest of the hut has two small pallet beds, a sharpening block and two grotesquely keen knives arrayed on a small wooden block. | x2 Uncanny Kobold Knife (1d6+1) |
| 5-6 | A kobold cowers in the corner, hiding ineptly behind a mound of rubbish. This kobold, Dreem, can be threatened into silent obedience by a successful Charisma (Intimidation) check. If the players succeed, he’ll answer one question honestly about the caverns or Mother Krangor. If the players fail, he immediately sounds the alarm and tries to flee. | N/A |
| 7-8 | A kobold armoury, containing racks of poorly made kobold weaponry. Two guards sift through the racks, backs facing the players. These kobolds aren’t easily cowed and fight back, sounding the alarm as they do so. | If the players search through the racks, they can easily find a +1 longsword and a +1 dagger— both stand out from the otherwise shoddily constructed weaponry. <br>+1 longsword(1d8)<br>+1 dagger(1d4)  |
