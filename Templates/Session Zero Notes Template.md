# Campaign Planning

> Write a short, evocative description about the essence of your campaign. Think of this as the synopsis of a book or movie, and come back to re-read this often! It will be your guide.

## Narrative Breakdown

### Main Arc
- Outline your major narrative goal for this campaign or arc. (Example: *"Defeat the Mad Lich who's been overusing and deteriorating the world's magic."*)
### Session Goals
- Break down your Main Arc into a series of steps equal to your campaign length defined above, in sessions. 
## Setting Information
### World
- Make a bullet point list of the major things that set this world apart. (Example: *The world's magic is deteriorating and becoming volatile, affecting spells cast within it. This phenomenon has come to be known as Aetherblight.*)

### Character Options
- Note down any restrictions or alterations to player options here. (Example: *Due to the Blight, spellcasters are seen as volatile and dangerous, and thus are usually shunned or persecuted in most settlements. Spellcasters will need to be careful when casting, as exposing their identity could get them in big trouble.*)

### Special Mechanic(s)
- Note down any special mechanics that might come up in your setting. (Example: *Every time you roll a critical failure on a spellcasting roll, take 1d6 magic damage, mark a Stress and lose a Hope. You cannot use Armor to reduce the damage.)
- If your mechanic is too complex for bullet points (such as the cooking system in Daggerheart's *Beast Feast* campaign frame, detail it in a separate document and link it here instead.)
### Major Factions

- Write down the major players in your setting, if applicable. This can include the Adventurer's Guild, a specific kingdom, notable bandit groups, etc.-- any faction that might play a key role in the narrative, especially if your players can use these for their backstory.
