# Strong Start  
  
Go around the table and ask the players to introduce their characters as they board the plane. Ask them to describe what their characters do as they take their seat.
  
# Scenes  
  
- [ ] ***Scene I: Introduction*** (~30min)
	- [ ] Players board the plane, pilot runs through pre-flight check, flight takes off.
	- [ ] Describe a few scenes that could potentially be weird in the context, but that could feasibly happen in an airplane:
		- [ ] Stewardess passes a note to a male passenger along with his drink, his wife settling in right beside him. An extreme **Spot Hidden** roll allows the players to peek the note as he opens it: '*Meet me in the bathroom after takeoff. -xoxo*'.
		- [ ] A little while after takeoff, the stewardess passes him by and he follows shortly after. A hard ***Spot Hidden*** or ***Psychology*** roll reveals his body language is very nervous and jittery, like he's about to act on an impulse. He's planning on cheating on his wife with the stewardess.
	- [ ] When appropriate, start the abduction.

- [ ] ***Scene II: Abduction*** (~10min)
	- [ ] Power goes out  in the aircraft, including any electronic devices inside. The plane remains airborne, but stationary.
	- [ ] People notice shimmering lights moving outside the craft (**Spot Hidden** roll)
	- [ ] Tapping and scraping on the hull (**Listen** roll)
	- [ ] After a moment of silence, the Mi-Go tear a hole through the metal and the cabin depressurizes, throwing everyone out the plane (*Extreme* **Dexterity** roll-- bump down to *Hard* if they're buckled in)
	- [ ] Players who manage to stay inside the craft can see the Mi-Go taking shape and crawling into the cabin. Players who are thrown out are in free fall for a moment before being grabbed and passing out

- [ ] ***Dreamscape: Interlude I***
	- [ ] The investigators wake on a cold metal floor. They feel like they're dressed as they were, but all their possessions are missing.
	- [ ] Exploring, they can determine that they're in a circular metal room approximately 25m in diameter. The ceiling is too high to reach.
	- [ ] Testing the limits of this reveals that their environment is unnatural (**SAN** loss 1/1d4)
	- [ ] When appropriate, move on to Environment One. Ask for a ***POW*** check. If successful, the players notice three white dots in the shape of an upside down triangle, with a red dot at the center, before their consciousness fades away.

- [ ] ***Environment One: Aniak***
	- [ ] Aniak Alaska (population 500), built around the Aniak airport.
	- [ ] New player bodies have been missing for two days
	- [ ] Players will awaken in a cabin lounge, in various states of undress and covered in blood, like they were about to engage in sexual activity.
	- [ ] The body of a mid-30s female, Jane Spencer, lies mutilated by the front door in a pool of blood. Knives still protrude from her open wounds (**SAN** loss 0/1d4)
	- [ ] Mirrors and/or windows around the room reveal the investigators' new bodies (**SAN** loss 1,1d8). Successful ***Spot Hidden*** rolls reveal a circular flap of skin on the vessels' napes. Examining it reveals a circular implant with a triangle dot pattern embossed in it.
	- [ ] Shortly after the corpse is discovered, the Alaska State Troopers + VPSO John Shangin force their way into the cabin. He's a friend of the players and wants to know what the fuck is going on.
	- [ ] Players will be arrested and brought to the station for questioning. Make NPCs demonstrate a range of responses-- John is heartbroken about his wife's involvement in this; some state officers might try to understand, others might be aggressive and confrontational.
	- [ ] Either by evading capture or being arrested, investigators learn through new reports that **their plane crashed two weeks ago under mysterious circumstances. Investigations are still ongoing. There were no survivors.** (***SAN*** loss 1/1d6).
	- [ ] When the investigators learn of their apparent demise, cross the towns boundaries, or when fitting, the spheres embedded in their brains will rapidly heat up, manifesting as a sudden, painful headache. Seconds later, they will combust and explode. The investigator with the lowest ***Luck*** stays alive just enough to see what happens to the others (***SAN*** loss 1/1d6)

	- [ ] ***Dreamscape: Interlude II***
		- [ ] Players find themselves back in that metal room. The scientist doesn't interact with them in any way.
		- [ ] Let them roleplay a bit, talk amongst themselves. When appropriate, move on to Environment Two.
		- [ ] Once again, ask for a POW check. If successful, the players notice the three white dots in the shape of an upside down triangle, and the red dot at the center.

- [ ] ***Environment Two: Bluff***
	- [ ] A week ago, 9 history and geology students and their lecturers, from the University of Alaska Anchorage, camped in the ghost town of Bluff. They were examining the remains of the Nome Gold Rush of the 1900.
	- [ ] The investigators wake up in sleeping bags. crammed into a tent. It's a windy late afternoon.
	- [ ] Six large tents are pitched in a circle on the outskirts of town, with a campfire at the center. There's a stream nearby where **all electronic devices were thrown, rendering them inoperable**. It flows into the ghost town of Bluff.
	- [ ] All objects that could reveal the investigators' personal identities have been burned in the campfire. Food, utensils, etc. are untouched. Textbooks on geology and the Alaskan Gold Rush, along with maps of the area, are in the tents.
	- [ ] In the center of the town there's a bomb, a large metal cylinder 6ft tall and 3ft wide, with three shaped inserts around its area: a square, a circle and a triangle. It detonates once all rods are inserted; or if the investigators walk more than a quarter mile away from the town; or if they remain in Bluff for more than three hours.
	- [ ] The test subjects are in three cabins near the bomb. Sounds that they make can easily be heard. Seeing one provokes a ***SAN*** 1/1d8. Putting a subject out of their misery is a further ***SAN*** 0/1d4.
	- [ ] ***Subject One*** calls out for help, saying she can't see and that she's cold. Her internal organs are suspended from the roof of the cabin, connected by webs of veins, arteries and muscle tissue. Her mouth is still connected to her lungs via windpipe, allowing her to talk. Communication with the subject is impossible. The **circle-rod** lays on the floor by her feet.
	- [ ] ***Subject Two*** makes garbled noises. His body has been rearranged. The mouth is extended and enlarged across his abdomen; eyes replace nipples; genitals sit atop the head; legs and arms extend from the groin to crawl on all fours; and the anus is in the middle of the back. His hands and feet are chained to the floor. He's completely insane. The **triangle-rod** lays at the opposite corner of the room.
	- [ ] ***Subjects Three***, ***Four*** and ***Five*** have had all bones removed, been melded together and spread thinly across the cabin floor. Open mouths moan, eyes blink, flesh pulses randomly and blood and other fluids occasionally spurt out of unidentified orifices. The **square-rod** lays by the door.
	- [ ] When the experiment concludes, the bomb detonates and players return to the dreamscape.

- [ ] ***Dreamscape: Interlude III***
	- [ ] The scientist speaks, through a combination of all investigators' voices together, and asks questions about the experiment. ("Why did you insert the rods without knowing its function?", "Why did you ignore the device?", etc.). It will not respond to the investigators aside from saying "Thank you". 
	- [ ] If the investigators question the reality of their situation or go in denial of what's happening, they simply mutter "fascinating..." before moving on to Environment Three.
	- [ ] Once again, don't forget to call for ***POW*** checks to see if the players notice the triangle pattern.  **Once they notice it a first time, they'll always see it.**

- [ ] ***Environment Three: Ruby***
	- [ ] The investigators find themselves in a circle, deep in the woods as the sun sets. They carry backpacks with camping gear, maps and personal possessions. Each is armed with a hunting rifle, two knives, and flare guns.
	- [ ] Nearby, a large metal cylinder lies embedded in the snow. It buzzes rhythmically and contains a **Formless Spawn** (*Keeper's Rulebook*, pp. 293-294). Flares are the best weapon against it. It flees at half HP.
	- [ ] Personal possessions reveal that the new vessels have names and real jobs, and they're all from New York, NY. 
	- [ ] They have invoices for rooms at a fly-in lodge near Ruby. There is an extra room booked for a "Joshua Passantino". Another invoice identifies him as a sea-plane charter pilot. He is waiting at the lodge to take them to their next destination, once they hike back to Ruby (around 1h travel).
	- [ ] If players didn't kill the Formless Spawn, it'll be lurking in the woods. They can successfully avoid it with a Hard Stealth check
	- [ ] Connecting the three locations reveals the same pattern the players have been seeing, which leads them to Eagle Island.

- [ ] Eagle Island
	- [ ] Eagle Island is covered in trees and crisscrossed by small streams. At its center there is a mound with an open mine tunnel, descending into darkness. The PCs feel a thrumming in their skull when they look at it.
	- [ ] The tunnel looks strange. Large and corrugated, like the ones they find in Alien vs Predator. It buzzes rhythmically along with the PCs skulls, getting more intense and more pronounced the deeper they go.
	- [ ] After 100ft, the tunnel opens into a cavern where the mi-go have mined. A phosphorescent green glow illuminates the cavern, source unknown.
