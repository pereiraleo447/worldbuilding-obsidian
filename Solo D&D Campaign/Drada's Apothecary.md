The shop is a two-storey timber and brick building, with a slate roof and a smooth stone floor. A small dragon's skull hangs over the hearth. Located on Fane Street, in an adventurers quarter of comfortable inns and bold explorers. The street outside is lined with street vendors hawking swords and daggers. Owned by Drada, a young female half-orc who is particularly interested in potions and alchemy of healing.

When visited by the party, Drada had no Potions of Healing to offer due to the war effort.
