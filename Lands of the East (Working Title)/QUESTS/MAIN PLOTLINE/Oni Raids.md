***Why are the Oni cooperating with each other? What is their goal?***
- ***Always a bigger fish.*** A bigger, more powerful Oni has climbed up the food chain. Oni society was chiefly founded on one philosophy: the strongest one rules; the rest bow. Clans would compete in bloody skirmishes until one chieftain died. The losing clan was absorbed into the winner. But for better or for worse, oni clans always average out to be relatively evenly matched. Or at least they did-- until [[Izamaru]] arrived. In less than three months he worked his way through the clans, brutalizing the chieftains and absorbing their followers. Oni aren't particularly known for their decorum in battle, but even by their standards, Izamaru was a monster. His swiftness and precision with the kanabo almost betrayed the bloody pulp the corpse of his opponents would eventually be reduced to, buckling and breaking in ways no humanoid could even conceive. 
- ***Oni Death March***. Izamaru, through the use of a cursed magical item, has achieved a lesser form of lichdom. The item is like a kanabo, but with a chain and spiked flail attached to the handle. By striking yourself in the back, you take a certain amount of damage (TBD) and gets to transfer that damage to an opponent on your next attack. The more damage you take, the more damage you can transfer...?
