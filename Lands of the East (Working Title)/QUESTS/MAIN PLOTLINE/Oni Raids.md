___
***Why are the Oni cooperating with each other? What is their goal?***

- Izamaru is an undead lich
- The oni are strategizing raids to kill and harvest as many souls as possible in order to strengthen their master


- ***What are oni like?***
	- Selfish
	- Egotistical
	- Bloothirsty
	- Eat people
	- Murder for fun

- ***What do they want? Why are they attacking the villages?***
	- If [[Izamaru]] was undead it would make sense. The demons are killing people to feed his soul jar.
		- What's his objective though? OH SHIT! Maybe *he's* actually the bigger threat, and the kaiju end up being the side plot. 

# Overview



# Background

The oni threat was thought to have mercifully solved itself years ago. Egotistical, selfish and extremely territorial, the most vicious of the yokai were only seen in the company of their own kin if they were participating in a fight to the death-- for territory, for power, or simply just for fun. If they're not doing that, they're probably too busy preying on small villages in the countryside. As it turns out, going solo really isn't much of a detriment when you're as powerful and savage as an oni is. So when three months passed without a single report from oni attacks, everyone just assumed they finally brutalized themselves to extinction-- and the world was happier for it.

And so it was... until about eight months ago. A small crew of [[Heirs of Kirin]] healers were dispatched to Matsuoka Village, a small remote settlement at the foot of the MOUNTAIN PASS mountain pass. A missive had arrived, saying the rangers spotted multiple oni skulking around the forest and they afraid a skirmish would break out between them, catching the village in the crossfire. The Heirs' reply was swift, requesting a local wizard to setup a teletransportation circle and carrion-mail the design so that a relief and protection team could skip the travel time be dispatched immediately. The entire correspondence took a little over 30 hours, and the relief party was dispatched within 3 minutes of receiving the circle's design. 

Unfortunately, it didn't matter.

The scene witnessed by the relief party was nothing short of a nightmare. They emerged in a small clearing amidst a cornfield, just large enough for the hastily drawn circle, and were immediately assaulted by the smell of smoke, death and burning flesh. Screams of pain, grief, and fear blended together with the sounds of bone cracking and flesh tearing into a chilling cacophony. The Heirs collected themselves and sprung into action, dashing out of the field and swiftly canvasing the area for survivors. Following the weak pleas for help from under the debris and hiding spots, they managed to rescue a handful of villagers, pointing them in the direction of the magic circle, where their wizard colleague had already begun the casting for the return trip.

As soon as the crew emerged from behind the houses, they were greeted with an uncanny sight. A tall female oni swiftly caught up with a fleeing girl, striking her in the back with her studded kanabo. The girl cried out a pained howl, but before she even hit the ground, the oni was already delivering a follow up blow to the back of her head, crushing it on the floor like a ripe watermelon. Her scream became a wet *crunch*, a splatter, and then silence. The relief crew readied themselves for what would come after. They knew what oni killed people for-- the eating. But instead, the female oni untied a small brass jar from her belt. As soon as the lid came off, the jar started to vibrate, and a whiteish-blue smokey substance started emanating from the mauled villager's corpse. The smoke coalesced, and was quickly sucked into the jar and subsequently trapped. Puzzled, the Heirs looked around, and not only did they notice three more oni, apparently working together on this raid since they weren't attacking each other, but they were also trapping the same white-blue smoke from their kills' corpses into their own brass jars. 

And as soon as the crew
