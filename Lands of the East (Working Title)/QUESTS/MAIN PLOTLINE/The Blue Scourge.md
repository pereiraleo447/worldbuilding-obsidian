# Overview

>*Reports of a lone oni, wreathed in blue flames, have spread like wildfire. This fearsome creature singlehandedly razes entire villages to the ground, yet curiously, always spares one or two survivors—a stark contrast to the brutal, clan-bound nature of his kind, consumed by bloodlust for every last kill. The survivors, haunted by the icy blue glow and the eerie silence that follows the destruction, speak of the oni’s eyes—burning with an intense, unquenchable anger that hints at a deeper, darker purpose. How did a solitary oni become this powerful, and what is the meaning behind his strange acts of mercy? Is this just a bio-magical anomaly, or is there more to the so called "Blue Scourge"?*

# Background

[[Izamaru|Izamaru, the Blue Scourge]] is a lone oni that terrorizes the countryside. Once a loyal and honorable warrior, Izamaru served the Kagehana clan-- an independent warrior tribe with ties to the [[Rising Blossoms]] that dedicated themselves to protecting the weak and downtrodden. Known for his strategic brilliance and viciousness in the battlefield, Izamaru was revered by his comrades and feared by his enemies. However, within the halls of the clan, the seed of greed festered. The Silk Purse caught wind of their relationship with the rebels, and as sizeable as the Kagehana clan was, it's hard to make money when over half your labor is provided *pro bono*. Three people was all it took-- a watchmen, who suddenly fell asleep at his gateside post; A patrol, who only had to overlook [[Nishikibe|a single stranger]] in their camp; and Izamaru's wife, who was just sick of living in mediocrity and wanted a grand life in the capital. Betrayed by those he once called family, Izamaru was left for dead in the aftermath of a brutal coup. His home was taken, his honor shattered, and his heart consumed by a fire that no mortal means could extinguish.

As he lay dying, the cold, unrelenting rage within him grew stronger. In his grief and sorrow, he was in no position to resist it. It wasn't long before he was completely consumed by his need for retribution, and this is when his transformation begins. He vowed to cast aside all other feelings-- his revenge was all that mattered now-- and in doing so, Izamaru was reborn as an oni, his body engulfed in pale blue flames that symbolized his undying fury and the bitter coldness of his betrayal.

Now known as the Azure Scourge, Izamaru roams the countryside, leaving a trail of destruction in his wake. Entire villages are reduced to ashes, their inhabitants slaughtered, save for one or two survivors. These remnants, left to tell the tale of his wrath, unknowingly carry a piece of his soul, their hatred for the oni fueling his dark magic and ensuring his eventual rebirth should he fall in battle.

The survivors speak of Izamaru's eyes—once filled with honor, now burning with an intense, unquenchable anger. His cold blue flames are both a weapon and a curse, reflecting the icy void within his soul and the relentless heat of his vengeance. As the Azure Scourge, Izamaru's quest for retribution is unending, his every action driven by the desire to avenge his betrayal and reclaim the honor that was stolen from him.
