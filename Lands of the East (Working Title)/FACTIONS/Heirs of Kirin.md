# Overview
```ad-quote
"*The hardest fight is the one without violence.*"
```

The kirinâ€™s head that is the symbol of the Heirs is a welcome sight in the aftermath of any disaster. It brings the promise of food, shelter, and the support of folk with no other motive than to reduce suffering. More than that, their arcanomechanics can redevelop lost infrastructure, improving the quality of life beyond that which came before. They are a force for good, physicians and engineers that bring help across borders, volunteers whose golden kirin crest is a light in the darkness.

# Past Actions
With the increasing prevalence of disasters in the past years-- both natural and manmade-- the Heirs are working harder than ever. They are the disaster relief group that digs trapped villagers out of landslides. They are the forest planters that renature denuded hillsides, ensuring heavy rain doesn't become a flash flood. They are travelling medics who bring relief to far-flung villages. They are stretched thin and in need of support, now more than ever.
# Goals
The heirs have three goals. The first is to reduce suffering. The second is to fight without violence. And the third is to teach people so that they can support, nourish and heal themselves. Their core belief is that each good deed creates a ripple effect that begets more good deeds. With enough time and effort, that ripple will cross the world, and become a wave of kindness and gratitude.
