# Overview
>[!quote] 
>*The echoes of the past are wise words.*

For the past few hundred years, the Chroniclers have been providing a service to all people of the Lands: objective record keeping. All chroniclers take an oath of honesty and secrecy. They can not tell a lie and, if asked, will keep secret anything they observe for a period of fifty years, recording the information on sheets of psychic paper that only the writer can read. Thus, Chroniclers are present all throughout the Lands-- in court rooms, emperor's chamber, and anywhere else where keeping honesty and transparency is paramount to fairness. 

To aid in their efforts, mages within the order have developed Historiomancy, a branch of divination magic that lets wielders look into the past. This magic requires a focus, typically an item that was present during the events that are being investigated. A kaiju's bone or an ancient crown would allow a historiomancer to witness the events from the perspective of the item, or the creature the item came from. This power is limited however-- the further back you look, the more skill it requires to bring the pertinent information into focus among the chaff of white noise.
# Past Actions

Over the past two centuries, the number of chroniclers has steadily increased and the volume of information stored in their Great Library has had to spread into extra-dimensional pockets. Thanks to their oaths, they have been witness to numerous contracts, ceasefires, and hostage exchanges, ensuring both sides stick to their agreement. Historiomancy's delving into the past has earned them friends and enemies; secrets buried for years have been unearthed, leading to innocent prisoners being released, and guilty nobles being brought to justice.
# Goals

The Chroniclers' goal is information; its acquisition, analysis, and storage. They value curiosity and discovery above everything but the truth. Secondarily, they act to make this process easier for their researchers, collaborating with the [[College of Hanabi]] to create long range communication devices.
