# Overview
Professor Minimoto "Copperpot" Bumbuku is the Dean of Arcanomechanics at the College of Hanabi whose research focuses on yokai infusion, coercion, and placation. He is the inventor responsible for the creation of fully functional prostheses and their magically infused variants-- inventions lauded by the [[Heirs of Kirin]].

***Personality*** 
- He has a penchant for mischief and harmless pranks, frequently greeting guests with electrified handshakes, detachable prosthetic hands, and mistaking the least important clerk of the group for its leader-- much to the chagrin of self-important [[Silk Purse]] representatives. 
- He is prone to hyperfocus, often forgetting to eat unless his staff-- a loyal and highly skilled group of scholars-- strategically place lunches in his path. 
- He tends to fidget quite severely during college meetings to keep his mind focused, including playing with kendama, shooting his slingshot or even practicing yoga.

***Appearance***
- Three and a half feet tall tanukin
- Wears goggles, a leafy headdress, and a tool belt with all  manner of flasks, instruments, and magical contraptions. He also wears practical, hard-wearing green robes, and is never without his wide-brimmed bamboo kasa when venturing outside.
- If he's expecting to work, he may be followed by a levitating toolbox or by scholars piloting the experimental strength-enhancing exosuits that are the current focus of his research.

***Speech & Mannerisms***
- High pitched voice, hangs on the first sound of a sentence as he organizes his thoughts.
- His speech is precise and stretches from the crass to the eloquent. He's just as likely to say "well that's a pile of shit" as "I believe the amplitude of the oscillations was augmented by constructive interference. That is... it went *boom*."

***Desires & Motives***
- His current goal is to create devices that help rescue stranded people after environmental catastrophes. He sees arcanomechs as one possible tool and is looking for a way to reliably power them.
- His home village was leveled by what the Silk Purse attributed to a kaiju's passing shaking the earth; this is the basis of his motivation to make such exosuits.
- He encourages any attempt at artifice or enchantment he encounters. He reacts positively when presented with unusual magic items or inventions and will often purchase them for further study.
- He respects intelligence, actions that benefit those in need, and a good prank.

***Fears & Deterrents***
- He fears that weapons of war may be crafted from his inventions.
- Since he sees the [[Silk Purse]] as a necessary evil, he cannot bring himself to supply the rebels of the [[Rising Blossoms]] with anything that could be remotely weaponized.

# Relationships

***[[College of Hanabi]]***
- Bombuku has little time for his stuffy dean colleagues, but admires the institution as a whole for its ability to get him what he needs to do what he's best at: inventing.
- His irreverence is viewed as an eccentric quirk by his superiors-- an excusable flaw, given the benefits he brings as one of the college's most prolific inventors.

***[[Heirs of Kirin]]***
- After rescuing his kin from a landslide years ago, he trusts them to use his inventions only for good.
- He views the them as a great opportunity to test out new tech in the field, especially prostheses.
- [[Captain Totsuka]]'s feedback on what's helpful significantly influences the course of his studies, and they are good friends.

***[[Rising Blossoms]]***
- Bombuku isn't unwilling to pass on old prototypes to aid the Blossoms' *humanitarian* efforts, but makes absolutely sure to stop short of any technology that offers even the slightest chance of being weaponized or used to cause harm.

***[[Silk Purse]]***
- He sees them as a necessary evil: they deal with the bureaucracy of supply line so that invention can happen.
- Unlike his more gullible colleagues, he doubts that the Silk Purse has the workers' best interests at heart.
- He searches for project funding outside of Silk Purse grants and bursaries, and does not really like [[Nishikibe]].
