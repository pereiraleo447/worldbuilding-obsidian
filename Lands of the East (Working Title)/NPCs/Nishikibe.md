# Overview

Born into a noble family on the decline, Takaomi Nishikibe attended the School of Shinobi, a wizarding school focused on stealth and illusion. His family's mounting debts brought him into contact with the underworld of the Lands-- thieves, assassins, and debt collectors-- a world where his skillset was highly coveted. He flourished for a time, relieving his family of their burdens, but was captured by a high-ranking Silk Purse councilman during an attempted heist.

Realizing Nishikibe's connections could prove useful, the councilman bought his family's debt and with it, Nishikibe's service. Now Nishikibe is one of the main handlers for Silk Purse's dirty work. He is their connection to the underworld, a disposable but useful pawn that can keep the merchant's hands clean.

***Personality*** 
- His time amongst the least moral and trustworthy made him a careful and observant man.
- He has a supernatural ability to predict people's wants and intentions, which combined with his quick wit, lets him persuade, coerce or otherwise manipulate with incredible efficiency.
- Hides in plain sight, often using illusion magic to change his appearance before meeting a contact.
- Confident to the point of arrogance, shows no empathy except when interacting with his family and does not shake hands.
- Avoids engaging with the unintelligent unless he's using them as bait, bargaining chips, or battering rams.
- Dislikes does who try to get to know him personally, seeing it as an attempt at manipulation.
- Despite his laissez fair attitude towards collateral damage, he abhors violence for violence's sake. Tying up loose ends is one thing, but murder without purpose is barbaric.

***Appearance***
- Tall and sinewy, with a shock of thin blonde hair.
- Long, delicate fingers; angular facial features, and a pale skin that speaks to many hours indoors, in shadow or obscured by illusion magic.
- Wears robes of black, mauve and gold of fine silks. With others to do his dirty work for him now, he rarely dons the deep maroons and blues he used to blend in with the shadows in the past.
- Carries a cane, which conceals a poisoned rapier, and wears his family's signet ring on his left hand.

***Speech & Mannerisms***
- Chooses his words precisely and has a calm, measured cadence in all circumstances.
- Soft spoken, using metaphor and clever wordplay to mask his true meaning, be it an offer of help or the threat of harm.
- Skilled actor, easily switches demeanor to whatever seems most favorable.
- His one tell is his family's signet ring-- in times of stress or discomfort, he rubs his thumb against it to remind himself why he must do this job.

***Desires & Motives***
- His family and their protection are Nishikibe's primary motivation, though only the councilman that controls him knows this. He is ruthless in the pursuit of his master's goals, knowing that his family's life is in his hands.
- He harbors a secret desire to dig up dirt on his master and flip the dynamic between them.
- Nishikibe admires cunning, quick wit, and the baility to engage with his metaphors and wordplay. He favors people he can understand, because that way he can predict them.
- He values people for the ways he can use them, ever-confident in his ability to stay one step ahead.

***Fears & Deterrents***
- Nishikibe acts out in loyalty to his family, but fears that the actions he must take might change him. What would be the point in becoming the puppeteer if he's constantly looking over his shoulder?
- To be in power is to be a target.

# Relationships

***[[Silk Purse]]***
- Nishikibe thinks little of pen pushers and bureaucrats, the chaff necessary to keep the world moving. But the world of shadows, trickery and manipulation... he's well suited to this.
- Though he initially resented being coerced into their service, he now sees the opportunities it presents-- namely keeping his family safe.
- He turns a blind eye to their misdeeds and does what needs to be done.

***[[College of Hanabi]]***
- These scientists are brilliant and blinkered-- just how Nishikibe likes them. 
- Keeps a close eye on new inventions, trading goods to profit from a changing economic landscape, and envisioning uses that their creator's never considered.
- He is not fond of Bombuku's contempt and practical jokes.

***[[Heirs of Kirin]]***
- The Heirs are a useful tool to keep the masses contained; donating to them is a worthwhile expense.
- He makes sure to ingratiate himself with them wherever he travels, bringing food and gifts of medicine. This also works to keep the Heirs away from the Blossoms' influence.

***[[Rising Blossoms]]***
- The Blossoms are a danger, and giving them even a little wiggle room is a mistake. If they should ever gain power, chaos will ensue, and Nishikibe doesn't like the unpredictable.

***[[The Chroniclers]]***
- Historiomancy makes him quite wary, as it poses a great risk of revealing his identity and role, and its one of the primary reasons Nishikibe has people do his dirty work for him. If he wasn't there, there's nothing to uncover.
- Avoids [[Ryoko]] for that reason.
