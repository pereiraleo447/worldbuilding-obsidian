# Overview
Once a paladin of the Oath of Honour, Captain Totsuka now dedicates her life to the Heirs' mission. She operates semi-autonomously, moving from disaster site to disaster site, ever furthering their aid mission and relief efforts. She's remarkable among the haniwa for sustaining two constructs simultaneously, Kinji and Ginji-- who often behave more like her unruly children.

***Personality*** 
- Calm and gracious, Totsuka is impervious to intimidation or coercion. She is perceptive and insightful, and is quickly able to see the thread of the past on a person's actions. She judges behaviors rather than people, and will always speak against injustice-- not confrontationally, but encouraging the perpetrator to see the error of their ways.

***Appearance***
- Write bullet points about the character's appearance, such as their physical attributes and the clothes they wear.

***Speech & Mannerisms***
- Write bullet points about the character's speech and mannerisms, such as a particular accent or the sound of their voice.

***Desires & Motives***
- Write bullet points about the character's desires and motives, such as a particular goal they want to accomplish or an underlying reason behind their current pursuits.

***Fears & Deterrents***
- Write bullet points about the character's fears and deterrents, such as things that scare them or that they're hesitant about.
