# Overview
Once a paladin of the Oath of Honour, Captain Totsuka now dedicates her life to the Heirs' mission. She operates semi-autonomously, moving from disaster site to disaster site, ever furthering their aid mission and relief efforts. She's remarkable among the haniwa for sustaining two constructs simultaneously, Kinji and Ginji-- who often behave more like her unruly children.

***Personality*** 
- Calm and gracious, Totsuka is impervious to intimidation or coercion. She is perceptive and insightful, and is quickly able to see the thread of the past on a person's actions. She judges behaviors rather than people, and will always speak against injustice-- not confrontationally, but encouraging the perpetrator to see the error of their ways.

***Appearance***
- Totsuka is a large haniwa, sitting a little above 7 feet tall. Her grey, clay skin is shot with veins of gold, scars of stories that Captain Totsuka will share on occasion. 
- She wears robes of white trimmed with gold, the colours of the Heirs, and adorn her body with turquoise jewelry.
- Her head is a large water pot, and she carries another couple, smaller pots hung around her large body.

***Speech & Mannerisms***
- Totsuka listens far more than she speaks, and will invite guests for a seat and tea, anticipating their needs well before they become needs.
- Whenever she does speak, her voice is gentle but commands attention. Her words are seldom trivial, and cut to the core of the matter at hand. Politely blunt, at times.

***Desires & Motives***
- To save those in need and spread peace and harmony.
- She takes great pleasure in supporting those that teach others.
- She responds positively to those that share their knowledge with others, and is happy to supply any who act for the good of other people with rations or even potions of healing.
- She values nonjudgement, patience, and complex musical rhythms that can be felt through the earth.

***Fears & Deterrents***
- Totsuka has a profound and existential fear of being just a cog in a machine where suffering is inevitable.
- She sees herself as a band-aid rather than a solution.
- She worries that when her life fades and she becomes nothing more than inanimate pottery, her sacrifice will not have changed the nature of the Lands.

# Relationships

***[[Master Roku (WIP)]]***
- Knew Master Roku and worked alongside him while he was an Heir. Totsuka was enthusiastic about the idea of Roku mentoring [[Ozai]], and reclaiming a portion of himself he lost long ago.

***[[Heirs of Kirin]]***
- She is endlessly grateful for the competence and generosity of her colleagues. 
- She feels that life is a daily scramble from disaster to disaster, and that her brothers and sisters are stretched thin. 
- She wishes the organization would stop, take stock of its actions so far, and work out a route to foment a more permanent change.

***[[College of Hanabi]]***
- The creations of these genius minds are phenomenal, allowing Totsuka and the Heirs to do more than ever before. But they're still bandages for the wounds that the world suffers.
- She hopes that if the creations of the College can do the work of the common man, everyone can live without suffering.

***[[Rising Blossoms]]***
- She believes that their means are right but their methods are wrong. There are dangerous individuals among them, people who could cause more suffering.
- She isn't entirely sure if [[Chuji Firestarter|Chuji]] is a member, but does suspect so. If true, she believes that Chuji holds an ember that could become a wildfire if pushed the wrong way, or be snuffed out if they lose interest.

***[[Silk Purse]]***
- Order is not a bad thing, and Totsuka is no stranger to the roads and wayhouses that the Silk Purse keeps safe. However, their tendency to reduce people and events to numbers is demeaning and dangerous in their eyes.

***[[The Chroniclers]]***
- Totsuka has high hopes for historiomancy, especially when it comes to figuring out the reason behind the kaiju's rampage. 
- She hopes that their new branch of magic could be the key to unlocking a peaceful era, where everyone understands each other and secrets are brought to the limelight.
