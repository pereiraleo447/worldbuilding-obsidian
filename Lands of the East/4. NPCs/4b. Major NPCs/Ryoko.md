# Overview

Ryoko is wiser than you'd expect for her years, but far less wise than she appears. Kitsune grow a tail for each century they're alive, but Ryoko was born with seven tails. From a young age, folk approached her seeking the pearls of her learning and, to be frank, she's sick of it. 

She found solace in books, magic, and the burgeoning art of historiomancy. They don't ask for advice and, with careful probing, provide fruitful answers. She has worked for The Chroniclers as a historian and a writer and, with each book release, her star rises. *Ryoko's Guide to the Yokai Realms* has cemented her place as a documentarian as well as her desire to never do book tours again.

***Personality*** 
- Bookish and self-effacing, Ryoko saves her energy and passion for research.
- She's extremely intelligent, possesses an eidetic memory, and is able to make rapid logical deductions as well as approach problem solving through a myriad of different angles.
- Not dismissive so much as distracted, but when someone-- or, more often, some*thing*-- grabs her attention, they have it entirely. The intensity of her true focus can be intimidating to some, and enchanting to others.
- She is tired of people assuming her seven tails means she's a font of wisdom.
- She avoids small talk and over-exuberance, finding it far more exhausting than hours of study.
- She baulks at violence and detests manipulation, cruelty, and lies.
- She values critical thinking and the ability to debate, and will often play the devil's advocate.

***Appearance***
- When not shapeshifted, Ryoko is a female kitsune with a cascade of thick ginger locks. 
- She wears lightweight clothing, typical scholar robes.
- Her seven tails are extraordinarily long and bushy, finding use as scarves, improvised chairs, or bolstering to help her reach higher bookshelves.
- She wears little jewelry and typically carries a bo staff from which hangs several paper lanterns.

***Speech & Mannerisms***
- Ryoko is blunt to the point of being rude. Her vocabulary is more developed than most, and she has a habit of pausing mid-sentence to try and remember the exact word she was looking for.
- When trying to recall information, she pictures a book in her hands and traces the invisible lines until she finds what she needs in her memory.

***Desires & Motives***
- Though not particularly adept at social situations, she still has a desire to connect with other people. Face-to-face interactions can be tricky, but her books' receptions have helped her feel valued.
- What would really make her happy, though she does not know it, is a pen pal.
- She believes that if she can find the origin of the kaiju, she will, through her books, connect with the people of the [[Lands of the East]] like never before.
- She is delighted to be presented with a new story, artifact or piece of undiscovered history on which she can practice historiomancy.

***Fears & Deterrents***
- She fears that her personality might lead her to miss out on life. Books are great and all, but there's just so much to experience! If she doesn't step out of her comfort zone once in a while, will she have experienced all that life has to offer?

# Relationships

***[[The Chroniclers]]***
- Ryoko feels like she's found her people with The Chroniclers. They're a varied and eclectic bunch, and often communicate by letters, which is fine by her.
- She's sure that through discovering the past, the future can be made better.
- The thought that digging up new facts might disturb the harmony of the Realms doesnâ€™t occur to her: the truth is paramount.

***[[College of Hanabi]]***
- The plan for long-range communication devices make her anxious. If you can't write it down, how do you know that you're going to say the right thing at the right time? If only they could invent a *quill* prosthesis that wrote at the speed of thought...

***[[Heirs of Kirin]]***
- On her travels, she's seen the good that the Heirs do and view their existence as beneficial. Her current quest is to discover the origin of kaiju; if she can do that, maybe that'll help the Heirs in some small way.
- The Heirs have a standing order to courier any kaiju fragments they find to Ryoko to help her with her studies.

***[[Rising Blossoms]]***
- Ryoko's stumbled into a Blossoms' spokesperson giving a clandestine rally once. She knows little of the struggles of the common folk, and their words could be dangerous.
- However, a quote from the famous writer Ducythides goes "the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must". That doesn't seem quite right.

***[[Silk Purse]]***
- The Silk Purse has a policy of not allowing Chroniclers access to their reems of records, allegedly for the privacy of their investors. Nevertheless, they use Chroniclers as witnesses whenever they have a public-facing announcement.
- Ryoko admires the efficiency of their bureaucracy, but is ambivalent to their goals; the wheeling and dealing of the business world is something she'd rather ignore, and something about Nishikibe makes her uncomfortable...
