Some kaiju were way too powerful to be vanquished, and so they were banished or sealed. But for a few, an echo of their essence remained here, mingling with the weave and forever tethering a part of them to the prime material plane. These echoes manifested themselves as the [[Primordial Remnants|Primordial Remnants]].

The NPCs each have a connection with one of the kaiju from ryoko’s in some form— bakuryou is a maiden who kinda worship’s him; raiko’s is a warrior, etc. kinda like Pokémon gym trainers in a way??

These NPCs are simultaneously a manifestation of that kaiju and their own person. It’s a weird state of existence…
