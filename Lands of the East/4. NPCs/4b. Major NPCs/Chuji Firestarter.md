# Overview

Chuji is a sheep in wolf's clothing. As a kid, their father was killed in a freak farming accident when strict quotas and deadlines caused the foreman to cut corners. Chuji's family struggled, and as a teen, Chuji was caught stealing food several times. As the hardships grew, so did their crimes, until eventually, they were caught and sentenced to death. But this was not the end. A member of the [[Rising Blossoms]] saw in Chuji the spark of rebellion, and brought their dead body to be reincarnated by a druid. And so, the soul that once belonged to a halfling male was transmuted into a female nishikin body and found life again.

Chuji's handler orchestrated the assassination of their new body's family and forged papers to show Chuji as the only heir. They were subjected to a strict regimen, learning noble etiquette and language, kendo and archery, economics and tactics. In a short time they acquired the skills to blend in with noble society and attended a boarding school where they ingratiated themselves with the cream of the aristocratic crop.

After graduating top of their class and gaining renown as a katana master and tactical genius, they've been sought by many nobles looking to include them in their retinue. They are the perfect inside person for the Rising Blossoms and use their position to further the rebels' aims. Only four people know about his origin: their handler; Zixl, the druid who reincarnated them; their friend and fellow noble Akio; and their bodyguard, Paxau.

***Personality*** 
- The epitome of charisma, Chuji is a natural leader. They fully embody the "carefree noble", bu thtir mind is constantly assessing their surroundings and making strategic decisions to further their goals.
- In battle, however, Chuji is a monster and a genius tactician. Those who went to school with them talk about the blood-crazed kendo duels and utter ruthlessness in simulated battlefield maneuvers.
- Though they don the airs of the high and mighty, they act generously towards the common folk whenever they think they're not being watched

***Appearance***
- Androgynous nishikin body with white and red mottled scales, Chuji's muscular physique is hidden behind the expensive robes they wear.
- Often carries an ornate katana and wears the ring of their house within the boarding school: the House of Raiju.
- Often accompanied by Paxau, an enormous haniwa that acts as their most trusted friend and bodyguard.

***Speech & Mannerisms***
- Chuji has an easy way with words, and his speech carries a midly flamboyant and overconfident tone.
- Their movements have a measured, senatorial air-- a facet completely lost during a fight.
- In battle, they are rage incarnate, displaying their skill with the blade with unmatched ruthlessness.

***Desires & Motives***
- On one hand, Chuji wants revenge, for the noble cast to be torn down.
- On the other, they know that a more gradual and peaceful transition will be better for all involved.
- They value loyalty above all else, but skill with weapons or magic will also catch their attention.
- Chuji always notices people who display a kind disposition towards one's inferiors, seeing this as the sign of a potential future ally.

***Fears & Deterrents***
- Chuji isn't afraid of their true identity being revealed, but they do fear that if it happens at an inopportune time, the Rising Blossoms may suffer.
- Their *true* fear is that, should an armed rebellion occur, civilization as it is now known will crumble and the Lands will descend into warring states, where the lowly will still suffer.

# Relationships

***[[Rising Blossoms]]***
- This organization is as much a mystery to Chuji as it is to anyone else. They only know three members of the organization: their handler, Akio, and Zixl, and trust them implicitly.
- They worry that the Rising Blossoms do not have full control of their organization, but have been reassured that the wayward ones acting like outlaws are just misguided and being dealt with.

***[[College of Hanabi]]***
- Though not often found in academic circles, Chuji has been impressed by tales of professor [[Bombuku]]'s philantropic acts through conversations with [[Captain Totsuka]]. They aren't as confident that technological advancement will help the common man, though.
- Chuji gathers whatever crumbs of new inventions they can find through his patron's connections with the College, passing them on to their handler.

***[[Heirs of Kirin]]***
- If there were anyone Chuji wants to tell of their true identity, it's [[Captain Totsuka]].\
- Chuji sees the similarities in goals of the Blossoms and the Heirs, though they do not share Totsuka's belief that it can be achieved entirely nonviolently.
- Chuji tries to meet as many Heirs as possible, scoring each's likelihood to aid with logistics and medicine in a war.

***[[Silk Purse]]***
- This is the enemy. Not the bureaucrats who push papers and get a paycheck, but the puppeteers pulling the strings, whose smallest movements spread ripples of inequality throughout the Lands.
- Chuji constantly studies the nobles around them, always trying to ascertain who is responsible for the organization's actions.

***[[The Chroniclers]]***
- Chuji has met [[Ryoko]] several times and is impressed by both her forthrightness and her books.
- Chuji doesn't believe that the Chronicles could be of use to further the Blossoms' aims. After all, history is written by the victors.

***[[Renjiro (WIP)]]***
- Helped recruit Renjiro to the Blossoms?
