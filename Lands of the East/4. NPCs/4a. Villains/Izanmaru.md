# Overview

- Izanmaru is a fighter lich who forcefully conscripts warriors to his band by slaying them in battle and resurrecting them under his command as undead
- His hunger for absolute power has led him to adopt a peculiar strategy-- he'll go around the countryside, slaughtering villages whole and leaving but one or two survivors, hoping that their desire for revenge will drive them to pursue power in their own right, to become strong enough to avenge their loved ones. Then, once their confrontation inevitably happens, Izanmaru will challenge them to a duel. If he wins-- which he always does-- their souls are forfeited to him, and forced to endure an eternity of fighting in his death march.

***Personality*** 
- Izanmaru is ruthless and pragmatic. He knows his methods are brutal, but he doesn't feel remorse. Power is the birthright of the strong; culling the weak is the natural path to claim it.

***Appearance***
- His most distinguishing feature is the wreath of blue flame he dons almost full time, obscuring his face and leaving but the silhouette of his mask's features and white, glowing eyes.
- He wears full samurai armor except for a helmet.
- The flames that cover his body take shape in a form similar to Itachi's Susanoo: long pointy nose, glowing eyes. Except his form also has long pointy horns and short, flaming hair, like Ten Tails Obito

***Speech & Mannerisms***
- Izanmaru speaks through telepathy
- His voice booms and echoes in the targets mind, and causes uncanny discomfort.

***Desires & Motives***
- Izanmaru's ultimate goal is to subjugate every other race to his rule. He believes that oniborne are superior, and is sickened by the way society discriminates against them.
- He desires ultimate freedom for his people, by all means necessary.

***Fears & Deterrents***
-
