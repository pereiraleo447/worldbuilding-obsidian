# Overview
Roku's younger years were spent fighting in the War Against The West. While his early mastery of lava Fusion bending quickly earned him prestige within the ranks, it also prevented him from rising the military ladder-- they couldn't have such a catastrophe-level asset sitting behind protected walls in a comfy chair. It didn't matter though. After witnessing the horrors that he was causing, Roku quickly swore off the path for a gentler way to enact change.

***Personality*** 
- Write bullet points about the character's personality.

***Appearance***
- Currently, Roku resides in a very well crafted fire opal pendant.
- While alive, Roku was a "gentle giant" in everything but stature. His soft, patient demeanor was a stark contrast to his hardened body-- first by his time in the war, and then later by his discipline in mastering the elements. Even after he left the organization, he still wore the old [[Heirs of Kirin]] uniform.

***Speech & Mannerisms***
- Write bullet points about the character's speech and mannerisms, such as a particular accent or the sound of their voice.

***Desires & Motives***
- Currently, all Roku wants is to spend time with [[Ozai|his son]] before his own second lease on life comes to an end. He knows that, short of necromancy or lichdom, he can't extend his life forever. So, like any good parent, he just wants to make *sure* his son is ready for the world.

***Fears & Deterrents***
- Write bullet points about the character's fears and deterrents, such as things that scare them or that they're hesitant about.

# Relationships

***[[Heirs of Kirin]]*** *(and [[Captain Totsuka]])*
- After his stay in the military, Roku dedicated a good portion of his life to working disaster relief. His rapidly evolving command of the elements was a great asset to the effort and quickly earned him a name-- particularly with Captain Totsuka, who greatly employed his talents and further enabled his mastery of the elements.
- Even after he left, his heart was always with the cause. He kept his old robes and a few trinkets, as a reminder of the good work they do and the values he hoped to impart on his protege.
