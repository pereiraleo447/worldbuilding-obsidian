## Overview


> [!abstract] Premise
 Yoakemori Village lives in a prosperous valley east of the capitol of Heian and has been blessed with good harvests and protection for generations, but recently, a shadow has fallen over the town. The village's warding stones were inadvertently broken by a handful of village youths, and evil *yokai* have crept upriver. This culminated in two villagers strangled to death by a *kappa* in the riverbank. Hoping to avoid drawing officials, and because his own son is thought to be responsible for breaking the ward, the town headman has refused to ask for outside help. Meanwhile, one of the other kids, named Chiyo, responsible for breaking the warding stone decided to make the trek downstream to repair it, and got herself kidnapped by bullywugs. Now, her distraught grandmother has secretly posted a rescue ad to the adventurer's guild in hopes that someone would come to their aid.

The party reports to the temple at the edge of town, where they're greeted by two women. The half-elf, Alnora, panics about her situation, while the awkward kitsune Yukiko attempts to comfort her, largely in vain.
  
## Scenes  

- Chapter 1
	* The party has accepted Sueko’s commission from a neighboring town, and travelled the Great East-West Road for a day and a half. A small trail branches off from the path, and this is where Sueko meets the party.
		* She takes them to the village and explains the situation on the way. Two villagers were found dead, her granddaughter is missing and she fears she will suffer the same fate. Something evil stalks the waterways downriver of Yae.
		* They bump into the village headman, Jinbei, shortly after arriving. He argues with Sueko about ignoring his authority and bringing outsiders in. The party can intervene (DC 14 Persuasion).
			* Success: Party stays at Sueko’s house and are free to explore the town without repercussion.
				* The family will provide basic needs, but have little to offer in terms of supplies. They suggest the party go into town.
			* Failure: Party stays in a secret hut a few miles downstream, and meets Kurion and Sarivol. Exploring the town will prove a little inconvenient.
