# Strong Start  
  
*What was supposed to be a simple delivery job for money turned out to be much more. The sleepy town that was your destination paints the horizon with thick plumes of smoke and the ethereal glow from the blue flame that consumes it. As you get close to the city gates, the sound of an explosion 
  
# Scenes
  
- [ ] The party makes their way inside the village, and are thrust right into the thick of battle. Villagers run for their lives as undead creatures ravenously pursue them, and a handful of monks try their best to protect the villagers at all costs. A young cleric stands his ground against a mob on his own, and yells out for assistance as soon as he sees the party.
- [ ] (Final) [[Izanmaru]], possessing the body of a shadow monk wrapped in stealthy robes, deals the final blow to Tenshin. When he notices the party, Izanmaru reanimates Tenshin’s corpse, steps back into the shadows, and disappears in it, along with the first [[Primordial Remnants]]. Master Tenshin’s corpse then attacks the party.
  
# Secrets and Clues
  
- [ ] Aohi Village was attacked and virtually decimated by the Blue Scourge around 50 or so years ago. Master Tenshin was one of the few survivors. The village slowly rebuilt over time with the help of the [[Heirs of Kirin]].
- [ ] Master Tenshin is presumed to still be in the temple, fighting to protect the town's [[Primordial Remnants]]. He could solve all of this rather quickly, but the fact that he hasn't means he’s busy with something else. Koutaro wants to go rescue him ASAP to put a stop to this madness and prevent more people from getting killed.
