# Strong Start  
  
*What was supposed to be a simple delivery job for money turned out to be much more. The sleepy town that was your destination paints the horizon with thick plumes of smoke and the ethereal glow from the blue flame that consumes it. As you get close to the city gates, a mob of villagers rush in your direction, their mouths screaming in fear. Hot on their heels, a small group of shambling creatures pursues them, thirsty for violence.* 
  
# Scenes  
  
- [ ] As the first encounter ends, one of the surviving villagers pleads for the party to help her son [[Koutarou]], saying "He's fighting alone in there, please go help him."
- [ ] As the party makes their way into the village proper, Koutarou is standing his ground against a few undead. While he's no pushover, its easy to tell he doesn't have combat experience. Regardless, he dispatches his foes and comes to meet the party.
  
# Secrets and Clues  
  
- [ ] Koutarou was out running errands for Master Lian when the commotion started. He doesn't know how it began, but the first building to catch fire was the temple. The undead creatures started appearing after that.
- [ ] Master Lian is presumed to still be in the temple, fighting to protect the town's [[McGuffin]]. He could solve all of this rather quickly, but the fact that he hasn't means he's probably busy fending off the undead. Koutarou wants to go rescue him ASAP to put a stop to this madness.
