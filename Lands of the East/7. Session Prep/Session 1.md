# Strong Start  
  
*What was supposed to be a simple delivery job for money turned out to be much more. The sleepy town that was your destination paints the horizon with thick plumes of smoke and the ethereal glow from the blue flame that consumes it. As you get close to the city gates, a mob of villagers rush in your direction, their mouths screaming in fear. Hot on their heels, a small group of shambling creatures pursues them, thirsty for violence.* 
  
# Scenes  
  
- [ ] As the party makes their way into the village proper, Koutaro is standing his ground against a few undead. A group of survivors huddle together behind a few monks from the temple, who are fending off the undead as best they can. As soon as the party clears a path, the monks quickly escort the refugees out of town. It’s clear to see Koutaro doesn’t have combat experience, but he addresses the party confidently.
- [ ] (Final) [[Izanmaru]], possessing the body of a shadow monk wrapped in stealthy robes, deals the final blow to Tenshin. When he notices the party, Izanmaru reanimates Tenshin’s corpse, steps back into the shadows, and disappears in it with the first [[Primordial Remnant]] . Master Tenshin’s corpse then attacks the party
  
# Secrets and Clues  
  
- [ ] Koutarou was out running errands for Master Tenshin when the commotion started. He doesn't know how it began, but the first building to catch fire was the temple. The undead creatures started appearing after that.
- [ ] Master Tenshin is presumed to still be in the temple, fighting to protect the town's [[Primordial Remnant]]. He could solve all of this rather quickly, but the fact that he hasn't means he’s busy with something else. Koutarou wants to go rescue him ASAP to put a stop to this madness and prevent more people from getting killed.
