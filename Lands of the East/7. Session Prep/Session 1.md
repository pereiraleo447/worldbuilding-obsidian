# Strong Start  
  
*What was supposed to be a simple delivery job for money turned out to be much more. The sleepy town that was your destination paints the horizon with thick plumes of smoke and the ethereal glow from the blue flame that consumes it. As you get close to the city gates, a mob of villagers rush in your direction, their mouths screaming in fear. Hot on their heels, a small group of shambling creatures pursues them, thirsty for violence.*
