# Overview

>*Reports of a lone oni, wreathed in blue flames, have spread like wildfire in the countryside. This fearsome creature single handedly razes entire villages to the ground, yet curiously, always seems to deliberately spare a few survivors—a stark contrast to the brutal, clan-bound nature of the rest of his kind, who lusts for every last kill. The survivors, haunted by the icy blue glow and the eerie silence that follows the destruction, speak of the oni’s eyes—burning with an intense, unquenchable anger that hints at a deeper, darker purpose. How did a solitary oni become this powerful, and what is the meaning behind his strange acts of mercy? Is this just a bio-magical anomaly, or is there more to the so called "Blue Scourge"?*

# Background

[[Izanmaru|Izanmaru, the Blue Scourge]] is a lone oni that terrorizes the countryside. 

- Lawful Evil
- Terrorizes villages to breed strong warriors. Through seeking revenge on him, Izanmaru hopes that his vendettas will pursue ever-growing power, at which point he will either propose an offer or forcefully conscript them to his death march.

# Izanmaru's Plan

- The Blue Scourge's ultimate goal is to mount a large scale assault on the capital, eliminating all who stand in his way.
- Everyone he's slain houses a piece of his soul, and can thus be resurrected into his death march. However, his magical capabilities are currently limited, so he selects the strongest warriors to conscript and leaves the rest of the bodies as sleeper agents, waiting for the moment of his final reckoning.
