# Quest Overview

>*Gargantuan beasts known as kaiju have been rampaging throughout the Lands. Manifestations of primal magic, their mere presence can shatter the ecological balance of an entire continent. Their origin, as well as the reason for their rampage, is unknown, but the destruction they bring is nothing but certain. Could this be part of the cycle of the Lands, or is something else amiss?*
# Background

Kaiju were meant to be summoned as weapons of war. In ancient times, shortly after the warring states of the Lands of the East consolidated into a single nation, the council of warlords engaged in a greedy campaign of territorial expansion. They conducted a summoning ritual, reaching into the Primordial Plane of Kaiju in hopes of using one of the great beasts as a weapon of war. However, they severely underestimated the might of the power they hoped to enslave. The summoning was imperfect, and it opened a rift between the planes. Primordial magic suddenly flooded the material plane, saturating and permanently altering the very environment around it. The warlords did get what they wanted thoughâ€” through brute force they manifested a primordial being into an unknown plane of existence, against its will, and attempted to forcefully harness its power. Threatened and afraid, stranded dimensions away from their home in an environment that offered nothing but hostility, what else could the beast do but respond in kind? 

The rampage began in earnest, and by the end, very few survived. To cover up their transgression, the few remaining warlords wiped the incident off the records and ran an extensive propaganda campaign to frame it as a devastating raid by an enemy country. The campaign was successful-- most of the victims witness to the true incident *died during it*-- and the seed of hatred planted that day sadly still bears fruit in the present. 

- Since then, the primordial magic has saturated the land. Particularly strong kaiju are revered as gods or guardians, and some even walk the earth in human form, protective over their domain.
- Each kaiju's relationship with humanity is different. Some are protective of it; others are indifferent or even antagonistic. Check each kaiju's page for details on their relationship to the humans around them.
