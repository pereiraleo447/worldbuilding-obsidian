# Backstory

- Rin's village was one of the earliest reported attacks attributed to the oni we now call the Blue Scourge, about 120 years ago.
- She was the only survivor, and likely one of the first vendettas
- She lost her entire family-- a mother, a father and an older brother, Renjiro-- and took refuge inside a [[Dylan's Character|hollowed out tree]].

# Relationships

- [[Dylan's Character]]
	- Witnessed the destruction of her village and was unable to assist. Instead, she served as shelter for the young fox.
- [[Xhels]]
	- Possibly lovers at some point? Idk. They mentioned ex-lovers, but didn't elaborate.
