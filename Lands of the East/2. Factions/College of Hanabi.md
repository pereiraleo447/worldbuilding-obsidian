# Overview
``` ad-quote
"A step, no matter how small, is progress."
```

The College of Hanabi is at the forefront of every major-- and minor-- technological and arcane advancement in the [[Lands of the East]]. Originally conceived as both a school and guild for pyrotechnicians, the school quickly grew beyond their original purpose, as its roster of alchemists, tinkerers and inventors alumni sought to harness explosiveness for means other than to dazzle and enchant. Before long, the college became a hub of invention and progress, with departments for metallurgy, chromamancy, and arcanomechanics at the forefront of magical and technological development.
# Past Actions
In its early days, bards of the College of Hanabi were employed by rulers of all descriptions, from emperors to village elders. Their magic-infused light shows could depict ships floundering on roiling oceans, the roar of epic battles, or the tenderest moment between parent and child. Most recently, the invention of fully-functional prostheses capable of replacing lost limbs has, with the help of the [[Heirs of Kirin]], aided those wounded by rampaging kaiju and other calamities.

# Goals
Progress, above all, is the watchword of the Council of Deans. With new technology comes investment, which begets more invention. Nominally, the collegeâ€™s guiding principle is the implementation of arcane discoveries in novel, practical applications to better the lives of all creatures across the Lands. However, more recently, its decisions have been made with the goal of maintaining its position as the most prestigious institution in the Realms... by whatever means necessary.
