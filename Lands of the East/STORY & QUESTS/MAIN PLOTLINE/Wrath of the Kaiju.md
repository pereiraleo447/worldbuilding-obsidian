# Quest Overview

>*Gargantuan beasts known as kaiju have been rampaging throughout the Lands. Manifestations of primal magic, their mere presence can shatter the ecological balance of an entire continent. Their origin, as well as the reason for their rampage, is unknown, but the destruction they bring is nothing but certain. Could this be part of the cycle of the Lands, or is something else amiss?*
# Background

Kaiju were meant to be summoned as weapons of war. In ancient times, shortly after the warring states of the Lands of the East consolidated into a single nation, the council of warlords engaged in a greedy campaign of territorial expansion. They conducted a summoning ritual, reaching into the Primordial Plane of Kaiju in hopes of using one of the great beasts as a weapon of war. However, they severely underestimated the primordial might of the power they were hoping to enslave. They manifested a primordial being into an unknown plane of existence, against its will, and attempted to forcefully harness its power. Threatened and afraid, stranded dimensions away from their home in an environment that offered nothing but hostility, what could the beast do but to respond in kind? 

The rampage began in earnest, and by the end, very few survived. To cover up their transgression, the few remaining warlords wiped the incident off the records and ran an extensive propaganda campaign to frame it as a devastating raid by an enemy country. The campaign was successful-- most of the victims witness to the true incident *died during it*-- and the seed of hatred planted that day sadly still bears fruit in the present. 

Since then, kaiju will occasionally "slip through"-- their primordial magic seeping into our plane through the cracks and, over time, forcefully manifesting the beast. Some of them were worshipped as gods by ancient civilizations; others were seen as calamity incarnate and woven into world-ending prophecies. Some lived and died unnoticed, but left their mark by eventually becoming part of the world itself-- small islands, protruding from the sea; underwater caves dug as lairs; misshapen mountains overlooking a settlement. 

And as the barrier between our planes continues to weaken, kaiju sightings are increasing in number. Decade by decade, the number of reports trends upward, and the governing bodies of the Lands have picked up on the pattern. Will they find a solution? Or will the Lands eventually succumb under the kaiju's might?

# Scenes and Encounters

- A massive caravan, easily in the hundreds, travels mostly in silence, escorted by [[Silk Purse]] officials / [[Heirs of Kirin]] volunteers. They are the only remaining survivors of a kaiju rampage a few towns over, and are to be relocated in a different town/city.
	- Could lead to a side quest where the players themselves are asked to help with escorting future refugees through a dangerous environment, or even helping this same caravan reach their destination.
