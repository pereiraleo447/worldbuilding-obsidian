# Overview
>[!quote]
>*"We will bloom."*

A grassroots organization of disconnected cells and discontented people, the Rising Blossoms are the least powerful and fastest growing faction in the Lands. With each small village's pleas for help that go ignored, before they inevitably fall to a rampaging oni; each new [[Silk Purse]] bridge toll that further cripples small merchants' chances of making a living; each yearly increase in local taxes with no visible return to the community, more people find themselves swayed by the propaganda of the Blossoms' travelling insurrectionists. The Blossom's spokespeople hear this, promising that a time of change will come soonâ€” and urging their audience to be ready when it does...
# Past Actions

The Blossoms work in secret, each member only knowing a handful of others. The true skeleton and hierarchy of the organization, if there even is one, is completely unknown. So far, they have gathered up supplies and built deep bases, readying themselves for armed conflict should that arise. More broadly, they seek injustice-- especially that of the Silk Purse-- and spread the embellished stories throughout the Lands. It's a powerful, if dangerous, tactic. Those folk too fired up by the Blossoms' propaganda have become outlaws and criminals, raiding trading caravans and merchants under the Blossom's black and pink banner.
# Goals

When the Egregious Emperors were thrown off centuries ago, the people missed their chance to get rid of the yolk of hierarchy and rank. Now it's the purple ribbon of the Silk Purse who strangles the common man, and it's high time it was overthrown properly. Local governments should be transparent, communities should have the right to self determination, and the individual's access to the means of production is paramount. The Blossoms' seek to mobilize the people of the Lands and find allies in positions of influence.
