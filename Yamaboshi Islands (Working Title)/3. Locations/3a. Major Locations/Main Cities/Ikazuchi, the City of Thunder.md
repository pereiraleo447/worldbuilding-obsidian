# Overview & History

> *Write a short, evocative description about the place youâ€™re creating.*

- Raiko's power can be felt freely within the confines of the city. The air is always a little tingly and you can feel occasional crackles in the atmosphere. The smell of ozone is always faintly present.
- Raiko has a short temper, and thus has a hard time controlling the release of his power.
