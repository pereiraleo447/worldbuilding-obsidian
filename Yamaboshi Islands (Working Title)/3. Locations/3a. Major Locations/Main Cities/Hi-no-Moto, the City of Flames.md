# Overview & History

> *Write a short, evocative description about the place you’re creating.*

- The city is perpetually lit by floating paper lanterns. When evening falls, they are lifted above the city sky by the [[Natori, the Everlasting Flame|Kaiju of Fire's]] magic, where they remain in almost statis until the sun rises again the next day.
- This is done not only for visual flair (even though that's a big reason), but they also act as a protective barrier surrounding the perimeter of the city.
