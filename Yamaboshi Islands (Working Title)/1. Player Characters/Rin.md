# Backstory

- Rin's village was one of the earliest reported attacks attributed to the oni we now call the Blue Scourge, about 120 years ago.
- She was the only survivor, and likely one of the first vendettas
- She lost her entire family-- a mother, a father and an older brother, [[Renjiro (WIP)]]-- and took refuge inside a [[Mitsu|hollowed out tree]].
