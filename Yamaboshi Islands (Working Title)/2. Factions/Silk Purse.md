# Overview
> [!quote]
> *"Order rules the Lands, and we keep the order."*

The Silk Purse is a conglomeration of powerful merchants, politicians, and economists. Ostensibly, they are just a guild, however the reality is quite different. Behind the scenes, they are puppet masters whose influence runs far deeper through the institutions of the realms. The internal landscape is one of plots within plots, of power shifting as easy as sand. Through the pull of a string or a nudge off a cliff, laws are passed, wars are declared, and machinations are set in motion, and despite their strict system of hierarchy and rank, no one is ever really sure who's manipulating who...
# Past Actions

Over millennia, the Silk Purse's carefully crafted campaign paid off massively. Through gifts, flattery, and cunning competence they secured their role as teachers of the emperor's heirs and began on their path to become the emperor's only advisors. Once this was achieved, they distracted the rulers with hedonism and luxury, passing favorable laws in the emperor's name. Eventually the Lands fell into rebellion and, sensing the turning of the tide, the Silk Purse overthrew the final emperor, Tokihito, in the name of the people. Since then, they've been remembered as saviors.

In truth, however, they are tyrants. Through their careful games of manipulation, they've allowed [[Rising Blossoms]] cells to gain resources and confidence, to the point where they attack Silk Purse garrisons. Then, when the outposts are no longer manned and the patrols don't keep watch, they pay criminals to raid and attack trading caravans and villages, and even commit arson. The subsequent war of mis-information turns public opinion against the rebels, including members of the [[Heirs of Kirin]] who come to aid the destitute villagers, and the Purse is welcomed back with open arms.
# Goals

Though each individual has their own personal goals, the organization as a whole has one singular objective: control. They aim to be the principal advisors to all rulers and figures of power, so that they can manipulate trade and remain wealthy. They affirm their positions as forces of good in the publics' eyes by constructing regularly spaced wayhouses garrisoned by Silk Purse watchmen who patrol the road and protect merchants and travelers-- often for a fee, of course.
