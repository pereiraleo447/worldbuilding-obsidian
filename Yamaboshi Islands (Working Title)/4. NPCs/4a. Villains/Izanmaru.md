# Overview

- Izanmaru is an amalgamation between a Death March and a traditional necromancer, with some inspiration from Naraku as well
- He can only resurrect the dead slain by his own hand, and can freely conscript them to his undead strike team . They retain elements of their personalities, but are otherwise under Izanmaru's complete control.
- Once resurrected, the dead can't be "recalled"-- they must be slain again. Their undeath is unconditional to Izanmaru's will, which also means that theoretically, they could break free from the spell that binds them-- though it certainly wouldn't be an easy task.
- Izanmaru can also possess the body of any of his thralls. If he does, magical blue flames manifest around the thrall's head.
- His resurrection requires the soul of the vessel

***Personality*** 
- Izanmaru is ruthless and pragmatic. He knows his methods are brutal, but he doesn't feel remorse. Power is the birthright of the strong; culling the weak is the natural path to claim it.

***Appearance***
- He wears full samurai armor except for a helmet.
- The flames that cover his body take shape in a form similar to Itachi's Susanoo: long pointy nose, glowing eyes. Except his form also has long pointy horns and short, flaming hair, like Ten Tails Obito
- Wears the ***Armour of the Oni King*** (from Ryoko's)

***Speech & Mannerisms***
- Izanmaru can use his thrall's bodies to speak in a slightly distorted version of their own voice, but his main vessel only speaks through telepathy.
- His voice booms and echoes in the targets mind, and feels like the air around your head is getting a little warmer.

***Desires & Motives***
- Izanmaru's ultimate goal in the campaign is to tear open a rift to the Primordial plane. He wants to build up an army as powerful as possible and establish his own domain on the prime material plane.
- To achieve that, he's collecting three ancient [[Primordial Remnants|McGuffins]]. He's gonna use them to destabilize the [[Yamaboshi Rift]] and summon a Kaiju
- And to achieve *that*, he sustains an “undead strike team”— powerful warriors slain by his hand and resurrected under his command, much like an Edo Tensei of sorts.
- His thralls retain aspects of their personality, but cannot defy Izanmaru’s will. They’re aware of what they’re doing and can be against it, but their bodies move on their own. (Epic battle rin and brother vs parents where they compliment them on how strong they’ve become)

***Fears & Deterrents***

# Relationships

***[[Master Roku (WIP)]]***
- Master Roku escaped Izanmaru’s thrall by binding his soul to Ozai’s necklace, thus preventing his body from being resurrected (Izanmaru’s resurrection requires a soul)
