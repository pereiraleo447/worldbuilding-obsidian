- The Five Han are the unique individuals chosen by a kaiju to interface their primordial magic with the mortal world's. Through accepting the role of a Scion, they are permanently infused with a part of that kaiju's essence, and granted access to their power, which they are now responsible for protecting.
- Primordial magic is way too strong for a human body to contain however, which is why the Han are constantly "leaking" magic. This can manifest in a range of environmental effects such as a constant static tingle in the air, or a permanent aura of heat emanating from their body, or being able to interact with water as if it were its own sentient being around you (ala Moana's ocean, but entirely created by the Scion). The way in which their magic manifests seems to relate to their personality and is not entirely within their control.
- The Han can call upon their kaiju's power at will, even manifesting them in physical form. Wielding such powerful magic puts a severe physical strain on their bodies however, and while not common, overexertion could even be fatal.
- When a Han is no longer fit to channel primordial magic, it is their responsibility to find a suitable new vessel to inherit their essence. The manner in which they do so is up to them.
