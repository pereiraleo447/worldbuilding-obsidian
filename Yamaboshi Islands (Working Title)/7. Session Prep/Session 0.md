> 800 years ago, the land was devastated 
## Plot Threads

- ***The Blue Scourge.*** Reports of a lone oni, wreathed in blue flames, have spread like wildfire in the countryside. This fearsome creature singlehandedly razes entire villages to the ground, yet curiously, always seems to deliberately spare a few survivors—a stark contrast to the brutal, clan-bound nature of the rest of his kind, who lusts for every last kill. The survivors, haunted by the icy blue glow and the eerie silence that follows the destruction, speak of the oni’s eyes—burning with an intense, unquenchable anger that hints at a deeper, darker purpose. How did a solitary oni become this powerful, and what is the meaning behind his strange acts of mercy? Is this just a bio-magical anomaly, or is there more to the so called "Blue Scourge"?
- ***The Flames of Rebellion.*** Tensions have been rising as the [[Silk Purse]]'s profit-obsessed government continues to strangle the common man. Rumors exist of a grassroots faction of disconnected cells known as the [[Rising Blossoms]]. They threaten that the Silk Purse has long overstayed their welcome, and that the “time of change” will come soon-- and urge their audience to be ready when it does.
- ***The Wrath of the Kaiju.*** Gargantuan beasts known as kaiju have been rampaging throughout the Lands. Manifestations of primal magic, their mere presence can shatter the ecological balance of an entire continent. Their origin, as well as the reason for their rampage, is unknown, but the destruction they bring is nothing but certain. Could this be part of the cycle of the Lands, or is something else amiss?
- ***A Window to the Past.*** A burgeoning branch of divination magic called Historiomancy is on the rise. Pioneered by [[The Chroniclers]], it allows the caster to peer into the past, uncovering the truth behind events. Originally conceived as a way to aid Chroniclers in their effort to record history without bias, it wasn't long before historiomancers were dispatched to all corners of the Lands of the East in an effort to uncover secrets previously relegated to undiscoverable mysteries. Thanks to them, many innocent prisoners have been freed, and guilty nobles have been brought to justice. Now, the Chroniclers are on the path to investigate the strange happenings plaguing the Lands– particularly the kaiju– and are looking for as much assistance as they can recruit.

## Safety Tools

Discuss what safety tools you and your players are comfortable using during this campaign. I recommend including the following safety tools:

- Write down a list of any potential sensitive topics covered in your campaign and discuss them with your players during your session zero. See [*Consent in Gaming*](https://www.montecookgames.com/consent-in-gaming/) by Monte Cook Games for examples potential topics.
- Describe your campaign's "lines and veils". Lines are any topics that **will not** come up in any form. Veils are any topics that will be handled **off screen or abstractly**. Ask the players to add any other lines and veils they may have. Write them all down and share them with all of your players.
- Tell all of your players to say the phrase **"let's pause for a minute"** to break character and address anything coming up in the game that may be uncomfortable. Think of this as a verbal X-card.
