Primordial Remnants are ancient kaiju relics of great power, left to the world by fell primordial beasts. Their extraordinary power comes from a rare occurrence: their primordial magic is in perfect equilibrium with their prime material magic. This combination allows the item to manifest feats of great power.

Izanmaru hopes to use them to destabilize the [[Yamaboshi Rift]]-- a giant magical scar that cuts the sky of the [[Yamaboshi Islands]]â€” and summon a powerful kaiju under his thrall.
