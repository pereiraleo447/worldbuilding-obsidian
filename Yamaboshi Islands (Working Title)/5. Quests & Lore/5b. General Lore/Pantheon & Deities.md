## Izanami, Mother of the Cosmos

Izanami is said to be the universe itself. She is completely removed from all mortal affairs, and her existence resides on some incomprehensible scale. Humans believe that once their souls are sufficiently evolved, they will rejoin Izanami’s cosmos as a star in the night sky, to live out eternity in peaceful serenity, casting their glimmer back onto the mortal world from above.

## Sun and Moon

The Sun Goddess and the Moon God, the two main deities of this setting, replace a wide swath of the original D&D pantheon, though not all of it. These deities mainly govern over human (and human-like races) affairs, making them the two most widespread deities in all of the lands. While there are a plethora of lesser and local deities worshiped all over the islands, the Sun and Moon are the ones governing all affairs that relate to humanoid life.

It is believed that there are two cycles of life, simply referred to as the Great Cycles: the First Great Cycle is a fleeting stay in the mortal world, where people are born, live, learn and die. In this cycle, they accumulate experiences and enrich their soul’s “value” in order to one day earn their freedom from the mortal world and transition to the Second Great Cycle, where souls that have accumulated enough value are ferried away somewhere among the stars, to rejoin Aglaia’s cosmos and be one with the universe. Souls that die without enough value are then reborn back into the mortal world into a different life, where they can (hopefully) correct and learn from their previous mistakes. 

The Sun Goddess and the Moon God are respectively split into three aspects, each one playing a role in their respective parts of the cycle of life and death. These aspects are deities in their own right, with their own personalities and responsibilities, but also part of a single entity– their existence is both collective and individual, simultaneously. As such, most people pray to different aspects for different things– a farmer might pray to Aurora for a fruitful harvest in the spring; to Zenith to prolong a family member’s life if they’re ill; or pray to Eldath for guidance during a chaotic moment in their life, such as a change in career or when moving from one town to another. Clerics and Paladins are chosen not to become exclusive worshippers of a single aspect and renounce all others, but because their values and/or mission happen to align with that specific aspect’s role in the cycle.

### Sun Goddess

The Sun Goddess is the goddess of creation, of action, of manifesting, of doing and of making. She rules over the First Great Cycle– the cycle of life, of birth and death, and over most things that pertain to the physical world and daily life. She’s the goddess of nature, of life, light, peace and order. She is split into three aspects, called the Daughters: Aurora of the Sunrise, Zenith of the High Sun, and Isolde of the Sunset. Collectively, they are just referred to as the Sun or the Goddess.

#### Aspect: Maiden of the Sunrise (Life, Light, Forge and Nature Domains)

Symbol: Sunrise

  

The Maiden rules over the beginning of creation. This aspect rules over children, but also parents, birth, and love, both romantic and sexual, as it’s what leads to the beginning of life. She also rules over creative endeavors such as songmaking, painting, dancing and crafting, as creativity is seen as “creating something from nothing”. She is heavily associated with inspiration, which is seen as divine in origin. She’s also the aspect most associated with Light worship, as sunrise is when the light is brought back into the world after the darkness of the night. Worshippers of Aurora are usually farmers, but also druids, teachers, expectant mothers, parents and many artists.

  

#### Aspect: Mother of the Solstice (Order, Peace, Light and Life Domains)

Symbol: High Noon

  

Zenith rules over maintaining creation. She’s the aspect that represents the hard work that comes after something is brought into the world. She’s the aspect of routine, being prayed to for blessings on day-to-day things such as a peaceful day at work or a fruitful day of labor. She also rules over medicine, healing– the prolonging of life and ensuring that it continues. She’s the aspect that rules over cities, politics and everyday life; of maintaining the order of things. She embodies the status quo– people don’t pray for Zenith’s blessing when they’re impoverished or going through a tough time, because they don’t wish to remain in that state. Worshippers of Zenith are extremely varied, ranging from nurses and doctors to politicians and ambassadors.

#### Aspect: Crone of the Sunset (Grave, Peace and War Domains)

Symbol: Sunset

Visual: A kind old lady

The Crone is the aspect that rules over the end of creation, ensuring that all cycles come to an end, including life– but not exclusively. She’s the end of war, but also the end of peace. She’s the disruption in the throughline, ensuring that the cycle of life and death reaches its conclusion, so that new creations can begin in turn. Worshippers of Isolde are end-of-life caregivers and morticians, but also just as many politicians. Soldiers and generals pray to this aspect for the end of conflicts, but also peaceful protestors and the downtrodden, who are wishing for an end to their suffering.

### Moon God

While the Sun Goddess represents creation, the Moon God is the god of mutation. He’s the god of change, of transformation, and ruler of the Second Great Cycle– the transition from the cycle of life into a peaceful existence into the afterlife. He’s also split into three aspects, called the Sons: Eldath of the Waxing Moon, Lorha of the Full Moon, and Theron of the Waning Moon.

#### Aspect: Beau of the Waxing Moon (Twilight, Order and Grave Domains)

Symbol: Waxing Moon

An 

Eldath rules over the beginning of change. He’s the aspect that ferries and helps dead souls that just saw their lives end with The Crone to transition from the world of the living to the world of the dead. He also rules over the passage from day to night. He’s a transition period between a new cycle, the beginning of a new venture or the start of a period of change. Worshippers of the Waxing aspect include many priests, especially those who conduct end-of-life rites and pray for the soul’s safe passage into the afterlife, but also entrepreneurs, and those starting big journeys that will bring great change to their lives– including many adventurers.

#### Aspect: Father of the Zenith (Arcana, Tempest and Knowledge Domains)

Symbol: Full Moon

Visual: A proud father

The Father represents the heart of change. He is the time when something– anything– is deep in the middle of transformation. He rules over change that is ever ongoing, which is why his worshippers include many academics and scholars– as the journey for knowledge is never ending, and thus, those who pursue it are in a constant state of transformation and improvement. Seeing as magic is, at its core, about changing and influencing the world around you, he also rules over magic. He’s the god of crafters, as they dedicate their lives to changing other creations (materials and ores, for example) into objects of their own design. Finally, he’s also the one ruling over aspects of nature that are constantly shifting, such as the weather and the sea. As such, worshippers of this aspect include most scholars and artificers, but also blacksmiths and, of course, sailors.

#### Aspect: Sage of the Waning Moon (Trickery and Death Domains)

Symbol: Waning Moon

Visual: A ruthless old man

The Sage, even more so than his counterpart The Crone, is an outlier among the Sons. A mischievous trickster and pathological liar, he rules over people’s darkest emotions and desires. Like The Crone, he is a disruption in the throughline of the cycle; unlike The Crone, he doesn’t do it for a higher purpose. His only purpose, it seems, is to cause trouble for his brothers. Nonetheless, his trickery is seen by his contemporaries as a necessary evil. Worshipers of Theron include tricksters, thieves, corrupt politicians and criminals, but also necromancers and morally gray wizards. His mischievous nature was, in fact, the original genesis of undeath, which he now also rules over– as a “prank” on his brothers, he created a way to interrupt the permanence of the Second Great Cycle and reintroduce souls back into the mortal world. As such, he’s the primary aspect worshiped by necromancers, liches and archliches.

## Other Deities

There are a plethora of other deities in the pantheon, especially for non-human creatures such as dragons, goblins and gnolls. These deities were not, in fact, born as deities– instead, they are exceptional members of their species that were born into the world and, in some form or another, ascended into godhood-like existence. Deities such as Bahamut and Tiamat, or the Lord of the Ninth Asmodeus, ascended into divinity not by being born out of Aglaia, but by simply accumulating enough power that their rule became uncontested. Magic, by all merits, is impartial to its**
