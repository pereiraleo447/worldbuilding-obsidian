Changes from Ryoko's:
- Hanamori have really, *really* long lives. They're kinda like ents-- super rare, live mostly dormant, are repositories of knowledge and live for as long as a tree does.

Keeps from Ryoko's:
- The life after death thing is very cool, so I'm keeping it. Same for the empathetic "powers" and pretty much everything else.
