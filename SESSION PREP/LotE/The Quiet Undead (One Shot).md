**Davos Family Crypt**
> [!abstract] Summary
> The journey to the Davos family crypt is uneventful. The path there leads out of town and winds like a snake through the hillside before coming to a stop outside a rusted gate. Beyond it, a small graveyard can be seen, the centerpiece of which is a mausoleum bearing the Davos name.

**Head Priestess Yukiko.** A shy, silver-furred kitsune eager to help the Davos family. She tried to investigate the crypt herself, but upon descending the mausoleum, she got scared and turned tails, opting to post an ad at the local adventurer's guild for help instead.
