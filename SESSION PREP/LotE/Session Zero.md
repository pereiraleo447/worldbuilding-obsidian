## Safety Tools

Discuss what safety tools you and your players are comfortable using during this campaign. I recommend including the following safety tools:

- Write down a list of any potential sensitive topics covered in your campaign and discuss them with your players during your session zero. See [*Consent in Gaming*](https://www.montecookgames.com/consent-in-gaming/) by Monte Cook Games for examples potential topics.
- Describe your campaign's "lines and veils". Lines are any topics that **will not** come up in any form. Veils are any topics that will be handled **off screen or abstractly**. Ask the players to add any other lines and veils they may have. Write them all down and share them with all of your players.
- Tell all of your players to say the phrase **"let's pause for a minute"** to break character and address anything coming up in the game that may be uncomfortable. Think of this as a verbal X-card.
