> 800 years ago, the land was devastated 
## Six Truths of this Campaign

What are the six most important things you want your players to understand about the world and the campaign? Share these with your players.

- Small, organized Oni raids have been laying waste to villages in the countryside, which is not only devastating but also unprecedented. Oni are selfish, egotistical and incredibly territorial, and they've never been know to cooperate with one another until now. 
- Tensions have been rising as the [[Silk Purse]]'s profit-obsessed government continues to strangle the common man. Rumors exist of a grassroots faction of disconnected cells known as the [[Rising Blossoms]]. They threaten that the Silk Purse has long overstayed their welcome and that the time of change will come soon-- and people should be ready when it does.
- Massive beasts known as kaiju have been rampaging throughout the Lands. Manifestations of primal magic, their mere presence can shatter the ecological balance of an entire continent. Their origin, as well as the reason for their rampage, is unknown. But the destruction they bring is certain. Could this be part of the cycle of the Lands, or is something else amiss?
- A burgeoning branch of divination magic called historiomancy is on the rise. Pioneered by [[The Chroniclers]], it allows the caster to peer into the past, uncovering the truth behind events. Originally conceived as a way to aid Chroniclers in their effort to record history without bias, it may prove invaluable in figuring out the reason behind all these strange events ocurring across the Lands.

## Safety Tools

Discuss what safety tools you and your players are comfortable using during this campaign. I recommend including the following safety tools:

- Write down a list of any potential sensitive topics covered in your campaign and discuss them with your players during your session zero. See [*Consent in Gaming*](https://www.montecookgames.com/consent-in-gaming/) by Monte Cook Games for examples potential topics.
- Describe your campaign's "lines and veils". Lines are any topics that **will not** come up in any form. Veils are any topics that will be handled **off screen or abstractly**. Ask the players to add any other lines and veils they may have. Write them all down and share them with all of your players.
- Tell all of your players to say the phrase **"let's pause for a minute"** to break character and address anything coming up in the game that may be uncomfortable. Think of this as a verbal X-card.
