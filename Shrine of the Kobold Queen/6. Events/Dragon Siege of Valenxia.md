After a five-year long pursuit and countless defeats, the hero party bore witness to the Dragon Cult’s final plan: an aerial siege on the capital city of Valenxia. With a small squadron of adult dragons led by the Blood Wyrm of the North [[Itharog]], the Cult managed to successfully lay waste to much of the northern district of the city, with a death toll of over three thousand people. After a prolonged battle, one by one, the efforts of the Hero Party brought the reptiles to the ground, where they were pounced upon by the combined might of Valenxia’s military as well as the many other parties of adventurers that answered the capital’s call. All but two dragons were killed. The two survivors were Isendraug, who was captured alive; and Itharog, who managed to escape with his life albeit grievously wounded.
