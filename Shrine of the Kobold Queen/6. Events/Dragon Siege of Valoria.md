After a five-year long pursuit and countless defeats, the hero party bore witness to the Dragon Cult’s final plan: an aerial siege on the capital city of [[Valoria]]. With a small brood of adult dragons led by the Blood Wyrm of the North [[Itharog]], the Cult managed to successfully lay waste to much of the northern district of the city, with a death toll of over three thousand people. After a prolonged battle, then king [[Edwin Eldran]] sacrificed his life to bring the wyrms to the ground, where they were pounced upon by the combined might of Valoria’s military as well as the many other parties of adventurers that answered the city’s call. All but two dragons were killed. The two survivors were [[Isendraug]], who was captured alive; and Itharog, who managed to escape with his life albeit grievously wounded.
